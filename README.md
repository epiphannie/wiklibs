Wiklibs is a Mad Libs-style game built using the Wikipedia API and WordsAPI.

This little program is a little limited by the precision of the information returned by the API. That being said, limited precision seems to lead to unlimited comedy! The long-term hope for Wiklibs is to improve the grammar-detection in order to help increase the accuracy of prompts. Stay tuned!!

To insert your own API key:
- Retrieve free API key from https://www.wordsapi.com/
- Fork the wiklibs repository at https://github.com/epiphannie/wiklibs
- Locate file js/apikey.js.example and paste your key in the indicated location
- Rename file to js/apikey.js, by removing the .example extension
- Save and run. You're in business!

To run without API key, there is a password-protected version on ann.mcwebsite.net
