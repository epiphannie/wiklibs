Wiklibs is a Mad Libs-style game built using the Wikipedia API and WordsAPI.

This little program is a little limited by the precision of the information returned by the API. That being said, limited precision seems to lead to unlimited comedy! The long-term hope for Wiklibs is to improve the grammar-detection in order to help increase the accuracy of prompts. Stay tuned!!

To run this program without getting your own API key, contact Ann for the password.

Otherwise, to insert your own API key:
- Retrieve free API key from https://www.wordsapi.com/
- Fork the wiklibs repository at https://github.com/epiphannie/wiklibs
- Insert your API key in the designated location at the top of appAPI.js
- Set var decrypted to true.
- Save and run. You're in business!
